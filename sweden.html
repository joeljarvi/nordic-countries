      <h1>Sweden</h1>
      <p>
        Sweden is a big country in Northern Europe on the Scandinavian
        Peninsula. It’s next to Norway and Finland. It’s the largest of the
        Nordic countries and the fifth-largest country in Europe. The capital
        city of Sweden is Stockholm, and about 10.6 million people live there.
        Most people live in cities in the middle and southern parts of the
        country. Sweden has been around for a very long time, since about 12,000
        BC. A long time ago, people from Sweden were known as the Norsemen.
        Sweden became a united country in the late 10th century. In 1397, Sweden
        joined with Norway and Denmark to form a group called the Kalmar Union
        but left in 1523. Sweden became a powerful country and controlled a lot
        of land around the Baltic Sea. Sweden lost some of its land over the
        years, including Finland, which is now part of Russia. Sweden was last
        in a war in 1814 when it joined with Norway for a while, but they went
        their separate ways in 1905. Sweden is a very developed and happy
        country. It has a king and a parliament that makes the laws. Sweden
        provides free health care and education to everyone. It’s known for
        having a high quality of life and is very fair to everyone. Sweden
        joined the European Union in 1995 and NATO in 2024. It’s also part of
        many other important groups like the United Nations and the Schengen
        Area.
