        Here’s a version of the text simplified for a five-year-old: --- Finland
        is a country in Northern Europe. It’s right next to Sweden, Norway, and
        Russia. To the west is the Gulf of Bothnia, and to the south is the Gulf
        of Finland, with Estonia across from it. Finland is quite big, covering
        a lot of land, and has about 5.6 million people living there. The
        biggest city is Helsinki. Most people in Finland speak Finnish, and some
        also speak Swedish. The country is known for having lots of forests and
        lakes—over 180,000 lakes! The weather in Finland can be cold and snowy,
        especially in the north. People have lived in Finland for a very long
        time. It was settled after the Ice Age around 9000 BC. Finland was part
        of Sweden for a long time and then became part of the Russian Empire in
        1809. After that, Finland worked hard to become independent, which it
        did in 1917. Finland had some tough times during World War II but
        managed to stay independent. After the war, Finland grew quickly and
        became a very modern and wealthy country. It became part of the European
        Union in 1995 and joined NATO in 2023. Finland is known for having great
        schools, a strong economy, and a high quality of life.
