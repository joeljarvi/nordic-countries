      <h1>Iceland</h1>
      <p>
        Iceland is a special island country in the North Atlantic Ocean, between
        North America and Europe. It’s one of the least crowded countries in
        Europe. The biggest city in Iceland is Reykjavik, where about 36% of the
        people live. They speak Icelandic there. Iceland is on a special part of
        the Earth where two big pieces of land meet. This makes it a place with
        lots of volcanoes and geysers that shoot out hot water. The land has
        lots of sand, lava fields, mountains, and ice from glaciers. Even though
        it’s close to the Arctic Circle, the Gulf Stream helps keep it warmer
        than you might think. Summers are cool, and the weather can be pretty
        chilly. People started living in Iceland a long time ago, around 874 AD,
        when a Norwegian named Ingólfr Arnarson was the first person to settle
        there. Later, other Norwegians and Scandinavians moved there too.
        Iceland used to have its own government and a very old parliament called
        the Althing. In the 13th century, Iceland came under Norwegian rule, and
        later became part of the Kalmar Union with Denmark and Sweden. When that
        union ended, Denmark controlled Iceland, and Iceland became part of
        Denmark in 1814. In the early 1900s, Iceland wanted to be its own
        country, and in 1918, it became the Kingdom of Iceland but still had the
        same king as Denmark. During World War II, when Denmark was occupied,
        Iceland decided to become a republic and stop being tied to Denmark. For
        a long time, Iceland’s people mainly fished and farmed to get by. After
        World War II, with help from the Marshall Plan, Iceland became richer
        and developed quickly. Now, it’s one of the richest and most modern
        countries in the world. It joined the European Economic Area in 1994 and
        now has a strong economy with finance, biotechnology, and other
        industries. Iceland has a system that helps everyone with health care
        and education, and it’s known for having a great quality of life. It’s
        the smallest country in NATO and doesn’t have a regular army, but it has
        a coast guard to help keep its waters safe.
