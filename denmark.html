      <h1>Denmark</h1>
      <p>
        Denmark is a country in Northern Europe where lots of people live. It
        has almost 6 million people, and many of them live in the big city
        called Copenhagen. Denmark also has two special places called the Faroe
        Islands and Greenland. These places are far out in the North Atlantic
        Ocean. Denmark is the southernmost of the Scandinavian countries and is
        close to Sweden, Norway, and Germany. Denmark has a lot of islands—more
        than 1,400! Some are big and some are small. The biggest island is
        called Zealand, where Copenhagen is. Other big islands are Funen and
        Amager. Denmark has flat land, sandy beaches, and a nice, mild climate.
        A long time ago, in the 8th century, Denmark was a powerful country with
        big ships. It joined with Norway and Sweden a long time ago to form
        something called the Kalmar Union, but they separated later. Denmark
        fought some wars and changed how it was run in the 1800s, which made it
        a modern country with good social programs. During World War I, Denmark
        stayed neutral, but in World War II, Germany invaded it quickly. After
        the war, Denmark was freed, and in 1973, it joined the European Union.
        Denmark is known for being a very good place to live and was the first
        country to say same-sex partnerships are okay. Denmark is a member of
        many important groups like NATO and the United Nations, and it works
        closely with its Scandinavian neighbors. People often look at Denmark as
        a great example of how to run a country well.
